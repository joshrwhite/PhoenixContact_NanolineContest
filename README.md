# PhoenixContact_NanolineContest
The Annual Nanoline Contest sponsored by Phoenix Contact and their Nanoline Controller

## Hardware for Competition

### Nanoline Base Unit (nLC-055-â€¦)

The base unit provided is powered by a 24 V DC supply. This voltage supplies power for 8 Digital Inputs, 2 Analog Inputs, and 4 Relay Outputs at a 5 A Maximum.

### Step Power Supply Module

Phoenix Contact provides a power module which steps Input  AC voltage between 100-240 V to an Output DC voltage of 24 V at 0.75 A. This allows wall outlets in the U.S. to provide the necessary voltage for the Base Unit.

### Digital I/O Module

The additional Digital I/O Module allows for three (3) more DC Inputs and four (4) more DC Outputs.

### Analog I/O Module

The additional Analog I/O Module allows for two (2) more AC Inputs and two (2) more AC Outputs.

### Operator Panel

The Operator Panel resides in the Base Unit and acts as the interface between user and machine. It allows the user to input commands and can display messages based on the automated tasks' operation. The Operator Panel can also be remotely installed to your system and wired via 10 Pin connection or Ethernet Cable to the Nanoline Base Unit.

### USB Module

This module allows the Controller to communicate with the NanoNavigator Software
